* TODO cpitch (pitch tracker) [2/2]

** DONE finish front-end, write config file
** DONE test on pitch files

* TODO eliminate weave dependencies [1/2]

Start with the weave code, rewrite into pure python, and cython.
Profile along the way with -n1 -r3

*** DONE vitterbi filter

+ weave :: 1.86 s
+ pure python :: 785 s!
+ cython, no typing :: 747 s
+ cython, some typing :: 202 s
+ f2py :: 309 ms!

Some additional improvements could be realized by eliminating extra
calculations - many of the particles have the same value, so there's a
lot of useless calculations.  However, this means the arrays become
ragged which introduces a lot more programming.

*** TODO dynamic time warping

* TODO ccompare (recording comparisons) [2/3]

** DONE revamp front-end

*** DONE do pitch and spectrogram in same script

*** DONE flat file output

*** DONE config file for front-end
