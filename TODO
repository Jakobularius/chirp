* TODO cpitch (pitch tracker) [1/2]

** DONE finish front-end, write config file
** STARTED test on pitch files

Looks pretty good, and I think the algorithm even works a bit
better. However, I'm getting some big outliers in the last frames of a
few motifs.  Need to track this down.

* TODO eliminate weave dependencies [1/2]

Start with the weave code, rewrite into pure python, and cython.
Profile along the way with -n1 -r3

*** DONE vitterbi filter

+ weave :: 1.86 s
+ pure python :: 785 s!
+ cython, no typing :: 747 s
+ cython, some typing :: 202 s
+ f2py :: 309 ms!

Some additional improvements could be realized by eliminating extra
calculations - many of the particles have the same value, so there's a
lot of useless calculations.  However, this means the arrays become
ragged which introduces a lot more programming.
