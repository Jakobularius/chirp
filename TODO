* DONE cpitch (pitch tracker) [3/3]

** DONE finish front-end, write config file
** DONE test on pitch files
** DONE try to fix pitch halving errors a bit by remasking

Masks could be used more effectively, I think.  If the user masks out
frequencies, this could/should be taken to exclude those values as
possible pitches.  This means masking the likelihood, not the
spectrogram (or in addition to it)

* DONE eliminate weave dependencies [2/2]

Start with the weave code, rewrite into pure python, and cython.
Profile along the way with -n1 -r3

*** DONE vitterbi filter

+ weave :: 1.86 s
+ pure python :: 785 s!
+ cython, no typing :: 747 s
+ cython, some typing :: 202 s
+ f2py :: 309 ms!

Some additional improvements could be realized by eliminating extra
calculations - many of the particles have the same value, so there's a
lot of useless calculations.  However, this means the arrays become
ragged which introduces a lot more programming.

*** DONE dynamic time warping

* DONE ccompare (recording comparisons) [4/4]

** DONE revamp front-end

*** DONE do pitch and spectrogram in same script

*** DONE flat file output

*** DONE config file for front-end

** DONE test

some slight differences between these distances and the previous ones,
even when running on same plg files; may reflect differences in
filtering.  Will need to run entire analysis to know for sure

** DONE fix race condition in output while loading files

** DONE write database import script

* TODO chirp (main gui) [9/13]

** DONE propagate any changes to backend code

** DONE calculate pitch in GUI

** DONE config file using my backend instead of wx.Config

** DEFERRED add dialog to set pitch parameters

** DONE allow holes in polygons?

** DONE fix next/previous

** DONE shortcut key for subtracting off regions

** DEFERRED log spectrogram display?

** DEFERRED more efficient spectrogram display, eliminate matplotlib dependency

** DONE load configuration from file

** DONE fix open dialogs in app

should remember last directory

** CANCELED store documentation in package

too much trouble trying to load package data in standalone apps - just
make a PDF

** DEFERRED PDF generation in chirp?

* DEFERRED csplitter [0/2]

** DEFERRED znote

** DEFERRED interval splitter

* DONE auxiliary programs [1/1]

** DONE cplotpitch (plot spectrograms and pitch overlay)

* TODO release checking [1/4]

** DONE check numpy dependency for versions

** STARTED documentation

** TODO py2app

** TODO py2exe
