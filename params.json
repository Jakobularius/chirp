{"name":"chirp","tagline":"Pitch and spectral analysis and comparison of bioacoustic signals","body":"## What is chirp?\r\n\r\nChirp is a suite of software for analyzing and comparing bioacoustic\r\nsignals. It consists of the following semi-independent components:\r\n\r\n-   A graphical interface for viewing conventional and [time-frequency\r\n    reassignment](http://dmeliza.github.com/libtfr) spectrograms.\r\n    \r\n    -   Select, play, and zoom in on temporal sections of recordings;\r\n        adjust spectrogram parameters interactively.\r\n    \r\n    -   Define temporal and spectrotemporal regions of interest; save in\r\n        simple text-based files for further analysis\r\n\r\n-   An advanced signal processing algorithm for tracking the pitch\r\n    (fundamental frequency) of tonal signals.  Designed for use with\r\n    noisy field recordings.\r\n\r\n-   A dynamic time-warping algorithm for quantitatively comparing the\r\n    pitch traces of signals.  Supports batch processing on multicore\r\n    machines for large datasets.\r\n\r\n-   Plugin architecture supporting additional algorithms for comparing\r\n    signals (currently includes spectrographic cross-correlation)\r\n\r\nThe current version of chirp is 1.2.0\r\n\r\n![nil](chirp_mask3.png)\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n-   [The project source code](https://github.com/dmeliza/chirp)\r\n-   [The project wiki](https://github.com/dmeliza/chirp/wiki) (includes tutorials)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
