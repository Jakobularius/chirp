** What is chirp?

Chirp is a suite of software for analyzing and comparing bioacoustic
signals. It consists of the following semi-independent components:

+ A graphical interface for viewing conventional and [[http://dmeliza.github.com/libtfrspec][time-frequency
  reassignment]] spectrograms.
  + Select, play, and zoom in on temporal sections of recordings;
    adjust spectrogram parameters interactively.
  + Define temporal and spectrotemporal regions of interest; save in
    simple text-based files for further analysis
+ An advanced signal processing algorithm for tracking the pitch
  (fundamental frequency) of tonal signals.  Designed for use with
  noisy field recordings.
+ A dynamic time-warping algorithm for quantitatively comparing the
  pitch traces of signals.  Supports batch processing on multicore
  machines for large datasets.
+ Plugin architecture supporting additional algorithms for comparing
  signals (currently includes spectrographic cross-correlation)

The current version of chirp is 1.1.2.
